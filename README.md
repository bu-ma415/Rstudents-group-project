Main question: Common overall violations within each city

Individual questions:

Gian - What is the pattern of violations geographically within each city? For example, what zipcodes have the most prominent one?

Seun - 1. Do specific categories of restaurants (e.g., 'Pizza', 'Sushi', 'Coffee Shop') disproportionately receive certain categories of violations (e.g., 'Pest Control', 'Food Temperature', 'Employee Hygiene')?
2. How do the types and severity (risk level) of violations found during 'Complaint-Driven' inspections differ from those found during 'Routine' inspections?

Niki - What month and season has the most food inspection violations across each city? Overall?

Arohi - What is the trend of most frequent violations been over time? For example, what are the most common violations in 2015 overall vs in 2020? Why?
