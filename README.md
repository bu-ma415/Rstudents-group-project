Food establishments inspection data from Boston, NYC, Chicago, and possibly San Francisco that we can combine and use:

Main question: Common overall violations within each city

Individual questions:

Gian - What is the pattern of violations geographically within each city? For example, what zipcodes have the most prominent one?

Seun - 1. Do specific categories of restaurants (e.g., 'Pizza', 'Sushi', 'Coffee Shop') disproportionately receive certain categories of violations (e.g., 'Pest Control', 'Food Temperature', 'Employee Hygiene')?
2. How do the types and severity (risk level) of violations found during 'Complaint-Driven' inspections differ from those found during 'Routine' inspections?

Niki - What month and season has the most food inspection violations across each city? Overall?

Arohi - What is the trend of most frequent violations been over time? For example, what are the most common violations in 2015 overall vs in 2020? Why?


Setup: 

1-2 pages for intro 

2-3 pages for EDA (most frequent violations, most common season they're committed, higher proportions of fails vs passes) 

6-8 pages for context for individual question + analysis + graphs + discussion



Motivation: large variety of different datatypes and there’s a lot of overlapping variables for each different city (so like violation type, location coordinates, comments, etc) 
- We did this because we knew we could join/merge the information into one cohesive dataset we can pull from 

We chose to do this because food inspection was an interesting topic of discussion that we all agreed we wanted to research 

Food establishment inspections dataset from health divisions of the department of inspectional services from 
- Boston 
- NYC 
- San Francisco 
- Chicago 

We took a main question and separated it into 4 individual questions that we will each conduct data analysis for about the specifics of each part of common violations within cities.

1-2 for results and conclusion 

1-2 pages for citations
